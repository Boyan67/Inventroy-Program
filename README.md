Demonstrates use of OOP principles

The program is able to:
• Print a list of the inventory, sorted in order of increasing price.
• What is the component with the largest number of components in stock?
• How many NPN transistors does Chartlins have in stock?
• What is the total resistance of all of the resistors in stock?
• How many stock items have unit prices above 10p?
